 </a></b></span><br>
     <span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"> A very interesting travel blog about my travels to the countryside in Japan. Each post has an ad, travel information and travel journal. All off-the-beaten tracks you don't find anywhere online.</span>
          Only in Chinese. But if you want a presentation in English, here is my <a href ="https://youtu.be/lRuEVA6Y-cE" target=_blank>talk</a> (youtube). I gave a talk on Japanese governments strategies on countryside tourism at the 2024 IDISK International Conference. This is off my field but I find countryside tourism in Japan well developed and I began to study the policies behind to learn more.

   My pipeline and tutorial on the XMM-Newton software ESAS, with a focus on clusters of galaxies. You don't find any tutorial more detailed than this.<br><br>
   
   
   <b><span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"> <a href ="https://github.com/poonh/ffmpeg_video" target=_blank>Making Videos with FFmpeg</a></b><br>
   Recently, I helped someone to make youtube videos. Originally I used an interface software but the free version has a lot of limitations. Plus, using a command-line software (like ffmpeg) can be faster for certain functions. Here is a very detailed tutorial on making simple videos using ffmpeg (like overlaying music, video and images). By the way, I leanrt something very important in this project - reencoding, but I cannot share the secret here!<br><br>

   <i><b>git clone https://github.com/poonh/ffmpeg_video.git</i></b><br><br>
   Then open <i>video_script.ipybn</i> with Jupyter Notebook and you are there. You can also use Github Codespace to run it.<br><br>
   
   <b><span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"><a href ="https://github.com/poonh/make_epub" target=_blank>Making an EPUB</a></b><br>
I am good at applying knowledge cross-field. Here is another example. I have some articles online I want to read with Kindle. I webscrape them and use my programming skills to convert them to epub. I am using the Bible as an example in this tutorial.<br><br>

<i><b>git clone https://github.com/poonh/make_epub.git</i></b><br><br>

<b><span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"><a href ="https://poonh.github.io/kr_saijo/" target=_blank>Oral History - An Ordinary Family Under Khmer Rouge (东广岛华人红色高棉证言)</a></b><br>

This is my first and only project in oral history. I know a family in Higashihiroshima(東広島), Japan who are refugess of the Khmer Rouge (the bloody regime in Cambodia from 1975-1979). I documented their lives before, during and after Khmer Rouge. This story is unlike any other stories you find online. This one is far less bloddy. What I want to know is their lives under the regime, and how it changed the family history, but not to learn about the "bloodiness" of the regime.<br>
    The story is originally in Chinese, and machine translated into Japanese.<br>
