     <span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"> A very interesting travel blog about my travels to the countryside in Japan. Each post has an ad, travel information and travel journal. All off-the-beaten tracks you don't find anywhere online.</span>
          Only in Chinese. But if you want a presentation in English, here is my <a href ="https://youtu.be/lRuEVA6Y-cE" target=_blank>talk</a> (youtube). I gave a talk on Japanese governments strategies on countryside tourism at the 2024 IDISK International Conference. This is off my field but I find countryside tourism in Japan well developed and I began to study the policies behind to learn more.

   My pipeline and tutorial on the XMM-Newton software ESAS, with a focus on clusters of galaxies. You don't find any tutorial more detailed than this.<br><br>
   
   
   <b><span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block"> Making Videos with FFmpeg</b><br>
   Recently, I helped someone to make youtube videos. Originally I used an interface software but the free version has a lot of limitations. Plus, using a command-line software (like ffmpeg) can be faster for certain functions. Here is a very detailed tutorial on making simple videos using ffmpeg (like overlaying music, video and images).<br><br>
   Just do:<br><br>
   <i><b>git clone https://github.com/helen-poon/ffmpeg_video.git</i></b><br><br>
   Then open <i>video_script.ipybn</i> with Jupyter Notebook and you are there. You can also use Github Codespace to run it.<br><br>
   
   <b><span style="padding-bottom: 5px; display: inline-block">Making an EPUB(in the near future)</b><br>
I am good at applying knowledge cross-field. Here is another example. I have some articles online I want to read with Kindle. I webscrape them and use my programming skills to convert them to epub.<br><br>
I need some time to tidy things up and will publish this project later. If you want to find a project to do and increase your ability of self-learning, it is actually a good one. Learn to use python <i>requests</i> for webscraping. Then, learn how an epub works by unzipping any epub. Simply change the suffix <i>epub</i> to <i>zip</i>, then unzip in the command line. Then you can begin.<br><br>
